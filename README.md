# poultry-health-detection-cnn
A computer vision-based solution for early disease detection in poultry farming. This system uses Convolutional Neural Networks to analyze fecal matter images and classify poultry health status, helping farmers identify sick birds before symptoms become visible. The project implements both MobileNet V3 for mobile deployment and ResNet-18 for high-accuracy detection, with comprehensive data augmentation and transfer learning optimization.
